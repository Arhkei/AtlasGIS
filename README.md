and a frontend component. The server side component uses the popular python 
microframework flask. The frontend uses react.js and utilizes ol-kit for the 
map component and the bootstrap4 css framework. Relevant links are below:

file utilizes this container image as well as providing a geoserver container
and a postgis container.  These can be found here:
